# Apigee Source
Have you ever felt like:
* Working with APIs is too hard 
* Every API has its own flavor of authentication
* It should be easier to create quick prototypes of applications

So do we, which is why we built [Apigee Source](http://blog.apigee.com/detail/apigee_source_twitter_api/) and the [JavaScript framework](http://apigee.github.com/Apigee-Source-for-JavaScript/) that makes the magic happen.

We're looking for collaborators to contribute on a contract basis, so [get in touch](mailto:jobs@apigee.com) if you want to build a better future.
